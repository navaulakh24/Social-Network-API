# Social-Network-API

## Description
This is an API I created for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, the Mongoose ODM, and Day.js to format timestamps. The seed data was created using Insomnia.
